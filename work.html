        As a self-taught front-end engineer, it's important for me to learn by doing. Creating projects have become a focal point in my journey.</p>
      <p class="project-description">Doing so helps to refine my design process and identify habits that can either be beneficial or something that
        requires improvement.

            <p class="site-details">I wanted to demonstrate to myself how much I've learned and how I think as I create projects without outside direction.</p>
            <p class="site-details"> 
              This was very good practice for me as it allowed me discipline in completing what I start and leading myself to do so.</p>

            This landing page gave me valuable insight on the typography, call to action designs, and fluidity that goes

            Creating different landing pages with entirely different 
              designs exposes me to a variety of areas of design and development.</p>
            <p class="site-details"> It's important to be exposed to different projects as it allows me
              more unique ways of thinking.</p>

              to have fun while striving for a career in this field. So I created this page using my friend's artworks.</p>
            <p class="site-details">
              This was also 
              the first project where I incorporated a slideshow feature, where it allows the user to view multiple images by scrolling horizontally for
              desktop and swiping for mobile.</p>

                change their website, while still keeping their brand identity intact.</p>
              <p class="site-details">This project was very exciting to me. I was able to reference a code snippet for a parallax effect
                for when the user scrolls down.</p>
              <p class="site-details">The goal of this project was to create a complete homepage. Complete enough that I could present it to their designer with 
              complete research and evidence to back up my reasonings for creating this design.</p>

              to follow along code by code on how to make a project using a language I'm not yet proficient in.</p>
            <p class="site-details">While following this tutorial I realized I should stick to finding tutorials involving Javascript and create it. The most
              important thing to keep in mind was understanding what I was actually programming.</p>
            <p class="site-details">This project provided a great breakthrough to how I should be practicing Javascript and implementing the concepts.</p>
