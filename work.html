        As a self-taught front-end engineer, it's important for me to learn by doing. Creating projects have become a focal point in my journey as a
        front-end engineer.</p>
      <p class="project-description">Doing so helps to refine my design process and identify habits that can either be beneficial or something that
        requires improvement.

            <p class="site-details"> This is my first self-led project I created a few months after I started learning HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p class="site-details">I wanted to demonstrate to myself how much I've learned and how I think as I create projects without outside direction.</p>
            <p class="site-details"> 
              This was very good practice for me as it allowed me discipline in completing what I start and leading myself to do so.</p>

            Creating different landing pages with entirely different 
              designs exposes me to a variety of areas of design and development.</p>

              more unique ways of thinking.</p>

              to have fun while striving for a career in this field. So I created this page using my friend's artworks.</p>
            <p class="site-details">
              This was also 
              the first project where I incorporated a slideshow feature, where it allows the user to view multiple images by scrolling horizontally for
              desktop and swiping for mobile.</p>
