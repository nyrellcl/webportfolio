# About
This project represents my ongoing progress and work as a developer. I've hosted my personal website on Netlify
and make my contributions here through Github. Making this website and continously adding to it helps me become a better
developer. The more I look at my website the more changes and refinement I want to make. Which I think is an important attitude to have
as a developer. 

# Goals
I want to update the layout of my website. Right now it's at a good spot, but I want to add more information and uniqueness to each section of my website.
I want it to encompass my progress, information about me as a developer and as a person. I also want it to showcase my skills more. 
I plan to add much more interactivity to serve the users visiting my site. So that, say, recruiters or colleagues can have a solid frame of 
reference and point of contact when they decide to work with me or better know me as a developer.

# What I learned
Through continously adding and coming up with different layouts for my website, it really made me aware of the importance of cohesiveness both in information and
in writing code. It's important that visitors are able to digest details about my work and personality seamlessly through my website. To only highlight distinct information, but also being flexible in showing parts of myself as a person. This gives them a great idea of who I am as developer, colleague, and person. Especially towards recruiters, future clients, and team members. 

# Focus points
I need to focus more on my typography. It needs more work and intention not only for my website, but in general as well. Although I have my go-to fonts, I want to also open myself 
up to more ideas and combinations that can help enhance the experience of vistors to my website. This will increase their interest and maintain their attention when reading through my website, current and future projects. It will also show professionals my attention to detail, design, and awareness of user experience.
