        <p class="article-details">I am a self-taught programmer and aspiring front-end engineer. I'd only recently restarted my programming journey on November of 2021. 
          I was first introduced to programming during my sophomore year of high school where we were taught Python. Admittedly, it was difficult, but overall,
          I saw how exciting creating things from scratch were. Unfortunately, my difficulties outweighed my passion at the time and I stopped taking the class 
          after two years.</p>
        
        <p class="article-details">Thankfully, it was through discovering the practice of front end development that re-lit my spark of passion towards creating and
          programming. After a week of research, I decided I really wanted to learn this skill and profession. I saw endless creations from other front-end developers 
          which made me want to create my own unique creations.</p>
        
        <p class="article-details">And so, I studied HTML and CSS as much as I could everyday. Thankfully, with my past experience in Python, grasping the concepts halved 
          my frustration. As I got more and more comfortable, I started making small projects from free courses, then projects of my own, completing challenges, to
          maintaining my own website!</p>
