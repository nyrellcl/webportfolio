        <p class="article-details">I am a self-taught programmer. I'd only restarted my programming journey fairly recently on November of 2021. 
          I was first introduced to programming during my sophomore year of high school where we were taught Python. Addmitedly, it was hard, but overall,
          I saw how exciting creating things from scratch were. Unfortunately, my difficulties outweighed my passion at the time and I stopped taking the class 
          after two years.</p>
        
        <p class="article-details">Thankfully, it was through discovering the practice of front end developement that re-lit my spark of passion towards creating and
          programming. After a week of research, I decided I really wanted to learn this skill and profession. I saw endless creations from other developers and it made
          me want to create my own unique creation.</p>
        
        <p class="article-details">And so, I studied HTML and CSS as much as I could everyday. Thankfully, with my past experience in Python, grasping the concepts halved 
          my frustration. As I got more and more comfortable, I started making small projects from free courses, then projects of my own, completing challenges, and making
          maintaining own website!</p>
